<p>More and more tourists are coming to Korea nowadays. South Korea is small but there are so many various things to do. But most of tourists are just going and hanging out in some particular places like Gangnam, Hongdae and Itaewon something like that. However there’s more and more things that you can enjoy here, but the point is it’s not that easy to find some informations about it for foreigners. Of course you can google it, but it feels like our professor “Google” always gives you the same and boring informations, recommendations.</p>

<p>So that’s why I opened this website. I would like to show the real local things and something special than the other pages that you’ve searched so far. It could be something minor nothing  like major things which travelers normally do in Korea.
 I’d like recommend you the things that I love to do, like shopping vintage stuffs, visiting old local bars, finding out some cool exhibitions, reviewing various stationaries and school things, taking pictures with film cameras and visiting photo studios to print that photos, trying to go on a bus trip, and so on. So you can find something interesting through my posts and figure out “How Korean geeks enjoy their Korean lives”.
I guarantee you that you can get more more ideas like ‘things to do in Korea’ from my page.</p>
