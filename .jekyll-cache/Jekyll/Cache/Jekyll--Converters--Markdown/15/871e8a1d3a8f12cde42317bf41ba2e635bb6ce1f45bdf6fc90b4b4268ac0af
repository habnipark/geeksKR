I"®<p>Back in the days, I just found some post and that post was about â€˜Kimchi fried rice recipeâ€™. 
 When I first read that post, I wasnâ€™t interested at all because Kimchi fried rice is one of the easiest foods to cook and very familiar foods for Korean.
 However, when I read the comments on that post, I was shocked and changed my mind to try to follow that recipe because every Korean was crazy about that recipe saying</p>
