<p>Since Seoul is the biggest city which is capital city in South Korea, so Seoul is always one of  â€˜must go placesâ€™ for foreigner tourists. so thatâ€™s why there are so many tourists in Seoul.</p>

<p>Here is a common list of â€˜things to do in Seoulâ€™</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve searched about â€˜Things to do Seoulâ€™, youâ€™ve probably seen this kind of list a lot.
Of course that list is also good, but you should know that because some of the lists are for foreign tourists only, most locals donâ€™t actually visit those places and donâ€™t do that kind of things.</p>

<p>Then letâ€™s check the list one by one from the local point of view.</p>

<h5 id="1explore-palaces--visit-cultural-villages-1">1.Explore palaces &amp; Visit cultural villages</h5>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/palace.png" alt="palace" /></p>

<p>For no.1, every places are breathtaking so you donâ€™t want to miss it. The Five Grand Palaces in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeonghuigung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, but you can just try some places that you want to go.
Most palaces have free guides tour so you can check that out and join without reservation (Individuals less than 10 people, but for groups with 10 or more people must make a reservation in advance).
 Also there are some ceremonies called â€˜The changing ceremony of the royal guardâ€™, and these are really cool so if you are planning to visit palace, make sure to check the time table of these ceremonies in advance. Plus, If you want something more special memory, you can also join the ceremonies so please check this out (http://www.royalguard.kr/0106.php)</p>

<p>There are also a lot of cultural villages such as Insadong, Ikseondong, Bukchon Hanok village, Samcheongdong, Seochon Hanok village,â€¦ Those places are usually not that big and all are located near Gyeongbok Palace, so you can look around at once and sightseeing doesnâ€™t take that long. Every streets have different vibes and also there are so many various street vendors and buskers, so it is really fun to take a walk looking around.
(Insadong is known for shopping especially for foreigners, but I donâ€™t want to recommend you because I find their products are little boring and way too pricy.)</p>

<h5 id="2shop-at-myeongdong-and-dongdaemun-1">2.Shop at Myeongdong and Dongdaemun</h5>

<p><img src="img/post/02/myeongdong.jpg" alt="myeongdong" /></p>

<p>For no.2, this list is really one of the lists that the locals donâ€™t understand. Myeongdong and Dongdaemun, of course, are one of the best places to shop, but locals rarely prefer this places because these places are way too commercial and crowded. Also things are really expensive since most customers are foreigners, so if you want to go there, I recommend you to consider a lot before buying something. (I donâ€™t recommend you to try some street foods in there as well, because even though itâ€™s not that nice itâ€™s way pricy.)</p>

<p>If you are planning to go to Dongdaemun, You need to be careful not to get ripped off! Some vendors in there could force you to try some clothes and buy and they tend to rip you off (They even do that to the locals) so you should be extra careful in there!</p>

<h5 id="3try-street-foods-1">3.Try street foods</h5>

<p><img src="img/post/02/streetfood.png" alt="streetfoods" /></p>

<p>In localâ€™s opinion, street foods in Korea are definitely one of the things that you should try! There are so many places for street foods, but I recommend you the markets such as Gwangjang, Tongin, and some college towns, and you also can try some unique street foods in Common ground, Seoul bamdokkaebi night market.</p>

<p>The traditional markets which are Gwangjang, Tongin are more reasonable than Common ground, Seoul bamdokkaebi night markey because for the latter, that places are sort of modern places run by young people therefor their foods are kind of fancy fusion foods.
I recommend you to visit both options because the vibe of the two options is totally different from each other.</p>

<h5 id="4enjoy-parks-1">4.Enjoy parks</h5>

<p><img src="img/post/02/park.png" alt="parks" /></p>

<p>There are so many awesome parks in Seoul so you can just search the list of parks in Seoul and try! Parks near by Han river are really cool so just give it a shot and never forget to try ramen there. Gyeongui Line Forest Park which is called Yeontral park is also one of the best parks in Seoul. Itâ€™s located near by Hongdae, Yeonnamdong. You should go to Yeontral park and grab some beer in the park while enjoying Peopleâ€™s busking there!</p>

<h5 id="5nightlife-at-hongdae-gangnam-itaewon-1">5.Nightlife at Hongdae, Gangnam. Itaewonâ€¦</h5>

<p><img src="img/post/02/hongdae.png" alt="hongdae" /></p>

<p>Hongdae, Gangnam. Itaewon are well known for nightlife, so there are so many stunning bars, but if you really want to enjoy localâ€™s places you need to find another places as well. Therefor I will post lots of local bars which is located in another district all over Seoul, so please stay tuned Geeksâ€™ things Korea!</p>
