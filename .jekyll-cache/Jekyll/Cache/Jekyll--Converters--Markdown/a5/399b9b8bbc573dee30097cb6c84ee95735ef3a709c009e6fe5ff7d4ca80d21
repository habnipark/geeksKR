<p>But there‚Äôs some places that my foreign friends and I love so bad, so I‚Äôd like to recommend you one of those place ‚ÄúMikkeller‚Äù today.</p>

<p>Actually Mikkeller is an international breweriy started in Copenhagen Denmark, and they export their own brewed beers to almost 40 different countries and almost 50 shops are also around the world.</p>

<p>Mikkeller Seoul is located in back alley in Garosu-gil so that there is not that crowded usually quiet.</p>

<p>When you arrived at Mikkeller Seoul, you can see Sally and Henry welcoming people politely in front of the bar.</p>

<p>You can easily find unique facade of the building cause the owner of Mikkller Seoul has worked with  Mikkeller‚Äôs Art director Keith Shore together to try to add some Korean elements to Mikkeller‚Äôs own Danish style. so that‚Äôs why I found their building facade is so cool and special out of this world.</p>

<p>They offer 30 different beers on tap from Mikkeller which are from Mikkeller, their own special brewed beer, and other selected  breweries around the world. They always take good care of beer quality strictly so you can always have freshest beer even from another countries.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/05/5_08.jpg" alt="menuboard" /></p>

<p>They have various types of beers APA, IPA, Fruit Lambic, Stout, Porter and even some bottle beers as well. They also have nice food and snack menu!</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/05/5_07.jpg" alt="glass" /></p>

<p>If you are a person who drink beers like water, this place could be little bit pricy because their glass is kind of small for its price in my opinion.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/05/5_06.jpg" alt="inside2" /></p>

<p>But as long as I can enjoy awesome beers and their chill mood I love to go there so I went there like more than 5times so far! So I could guarantee you‚Äôll love this place too!</p>

<p>So why don‚Äôt you hang around and drink with friends? :)</p>
