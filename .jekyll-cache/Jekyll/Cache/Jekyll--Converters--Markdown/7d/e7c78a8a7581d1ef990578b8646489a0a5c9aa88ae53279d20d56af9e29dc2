I"k<p>Back in the days, I just found some post and that post was about ‘Kimchi fried rice recipe’. 
 When I first read that post, I wasn’t interested at all because Kimchi fried rice is one of the easiest foods to cook and very familiar foods for Korean.
 However, when I read the comments on that post, I was shocked and changed my mind to try to follow that recipe because every Korean was crazy about that recipe saying</p>

<p><strong>“There’s no other Kimchi fried rice except for this for the rest of my life! “</strong></p>

<p>After that day, You know what? I can’t remember exactly but I think I had Kimchi fried rices for almost more than 7 days in a row!!! And I still cook this often following that legendary recipe  because whenever It comes to my mind I have a craving for this food.</p>

<h5 id="tips">Tips!</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tuna is optional so you can use another ingredients like ham, bacon, meat, mushroom and so on but the original recipe is ‘using canned tuna’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red pepper powder is important ingredient! we use this ingredient instead of Gochujang for this original legendary Kimchi fried rice recipe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oligosaccharide, corn syrup is also important you can use honey also but the former is batter. and we also use this this ingredient instead of sugar.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Dasida(Korean beef stock) is most important ingredient! You can buy this easily at Kmart or you can also use beef stock</p>
