<p>South Korea is small but there are so many various things to do, so more and more tourists are coming to Korea nowadays. Most of tourists are just visiting some particular places like Gangnam, Hongdae and Itaewon something like that. However thereâ€™s more and more things that you can enjoy here, but the point is itâ€™s not that easy to find some informations about it for foreigners. Of course you can google it, but it feels like our professor â€œGoogleâ€ always gives you the same and boring informations and recommendations.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s why I opened this website. I would like to show the real local things and something special than the other pages that youâ€™ve searched so far. It could be something minor nothing like major things which travelers normally search for and do in Korea.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like recommend you the things that I love to do, like shopping vintage stuffs, visiting old local bars, finding out some cool exhibitions, reviewing various stationaries and school things, taking pictures with film cameras and visiting photo studios to print that photos, trying to go on a bus trip, and so on.  So you can find something interesting through my posts and figure out â€œHow Korean geeks enjoy their Korean livesâ€.</p>

<p>I guarantee you that you can get more more ideas like â€˜things to do in Koreaâ€™ from my page.</p>
