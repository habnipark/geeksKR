<p>As you might know, Korea is a peninsula so there are so many seafoods.</p>

<p>So it’s really easy to find some seafood(fish) markets and seafood restaurants as well.</p>

<p>#### Fish markets in Korea</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/03/market.jpg" alt="fishmarket" /></p>

<p>Many foreigner tourists in Korea visit Noryangjin, Garak, Mapo Agricultural &amp; Marine Products …Market fish Markets (in Seoul) and Jagalchi fish market (in Busan).</p>

<p>Those fish markets are really one of the biggest fish markets in Korea, so you can enjoy and experience so many interesting things like atmosphere of market, various sea creatures, scenery in there.</p>

<p>For those reasons, so many photographers or people who really are into taking pictures (or some Youtube Vloggers as well) go those markets for taking pictures of awesome and weird sea creatures!(You can even see some penis fish!)</p>

<p>It’s really okay to feel free to take some pictures of those so if you are interested, just give it a shot!</p>

<p>Plus, Actually These fish markets became more famous since Conan o’brien visited one of them  ‘Noryangjin’, so Please check this video out if you didn’t watch this super hilarious video!</p>

<hr />

<p>In the market, some people just don’t tend to buy any seafood but just want to enjoy wandering and looking around.</p>

<p>However if you want to try some seafood, you can just choose whatever you want to buy with vendor! Then the vendor will weigh it and tell you the price.</p>

<p>They(Noryangjin, Garak markets) also have restaurants in the market upstairs, so they also guide you to the restaurant and also slice or cook what you purchased.</p>

<p>You should keep in mind Don’t purchase right away. Just try to negotiate first and look around several stores!</p>

<p>ANYWAY some just want to avoid wet, hectic fish market experiences.</p>

<p>If you are including them, then you can simply go to seafood restaurant like sashimi place which is called ‘Hoet-jib’!</p>

<p>There are so many sashimi places in Korea because tons of Koreans love sashimi!</p>

<h4 id="sashimi--hoe">Sashimi : ‘Hoe’</h4>

<p>Typically, There are 2 kinds of sashimi in Korea.</p>

<p>The first one is Hwareo-hoe (활어회) which is prepared by filleting(slicing) freshly killed fish, and second one Sukseong-hoe (숙성회) which is made with a similar way as Japanese sashimi: ageing the fish at a certain temperature before filleting(slicing).</p>

<p>So the latter is little bit colder than former and they have different taste so you can just try both of them if you are a seafood lover!</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/03/3sauces.jpg" alt="3sauces" /></p>

<p>Sashimi and seafood is often served with 3types of sauces.</p>

<p>Cho-gochujang(chili paste mixed with vinegar) which is gochujang-based dipping sauces, Ssamjang, Soy sauce with Wasabi, so try all of them!</p>

<p>Sashimi is often eaten wrapped in ssam (wrap) vegetables, such as lettuce and perilla leaves like the way to eat Samgeopsal as well.</p>

<h4 id="maeun-tang-spicy-fish-stew">Maeun-tang (spicy fish stew)</h4>

<p><img src="/img/post/03/stew.jpg" alt="fish stew" /></p>

<p>After finishing sashimi at a restaurant, you can order Maeun-tang (spicy fish stew) made with the bones, head, and the remaining meat of the fish, and you need to pay extra charge like 5000won or something.</p>

<p>This food really goes very well with soju so if you love Soju and some spicy Soups in Korea like various Jjigae or Ramyeon, you don’t want to miss it!</p>
