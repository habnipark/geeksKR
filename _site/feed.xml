&lt;p&gt;As you might know, Korea is a peninsula so there are so many seafoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s really easy to find some seafood(fish) markets and seafood restaurants as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;koreamap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fish-markets-in-korea&quot;&gt;Fish markets in Korea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/market.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fishmarket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many foreigner tourists in Korea visit Noryangjin, Garak fish Markets, Mapo Agricultural &amp;amp; Marine Products market (in Seoul) and Jagalchi fish market (in Busan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those fish markets are really one of the biggest fish markets in Korea, so you can enjoy and experience so many interesting things like atmosphere of market, various sea creatures, scenery in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, so many photographers or people who really are into taking pictures (or some Youtube Vloggers as well) go those markets for taking pictures of awesome and weird sea creatures!  You can even see some penis fish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really okay to feel free to take some pictures of those so if you are interested, just give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/-FzDN86CskA&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teamcoco.com/node/93972/share.png&quot; alt=&quot;Video Label&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click the image to Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, Actually These fish markets became more famous since Conan o’brien visited one of them  ‘Noryangjin’, so Please check this video out if you didn’t watch this super hilarious video!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/slice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;slice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the market, some people just don’t tend to buy any seafood but just want to enjoy wandering and looking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you want to try some seafood, you can just choose whatever you want to buy with vendor! Then the vendor will weigh it and tell you the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They(Noryangjin, Garak markets) also have restaurants in the market upstairs, so they also guide you to the restaurant and also slice or cook what you purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should keep in mind Don’t purchase right away. Just try to negotiate first and look around several stores!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sashimi--seafood-restaurant--횟집&quot;&gt;Sashimi &amp;amp; seafood restaurant : “횟집”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY some just want to avoid wet, hectic fish market experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are including them, then you can simply go to seafood restaurant like sashimi place which is called ‘Hoet-jib’!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many sashimi places in Korea because tons of Koreans love sashimi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/coolgirl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coolgirl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like this cool girl infront of the restaurant!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sashimi--hoe&quot;&gt;Sashimi : ‘Hoe’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, There are 2 kinds of sashimi in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is Hwareo-hoe (활어회) which is prepared by filleting(slicing) freshly killed fish, and second one Sukseong-hoe (숙성회) which is made with a similar way as Japanese sashimi: ageing the fish at a certain temperature before filleting(slicing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the latter is little bit colder than former and they have different taste so you can just try both of them if you are a seafood lover!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;japanese-style-sashimi&quot;&gt;Japanese style sashimi&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/jpss.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;japanesestyle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;korean-style-sashimi-hoe&quot;&gt;Korean style sashimi ‘Hoe’&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/krss.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;koreanstyle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;various-types-of-sashimi&quot;&gt;Various types of sashimi&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/variousss.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;various&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/variousss2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;various&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sauces&quot;&gt;Sauces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/3sauces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3sauces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sashimi and seafood is often served with 3types of sauces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cho-gochujang(chili paste mixed with vinegar) which is gochujang-based dipping sauces, Ssamjang, Soy sauce with Wasabi, so try all of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sashimi is often eaten wrapped in ssam (wrap) vegetables, such as lettuce and perilla leaves like the way to eat Samgeopsal as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maeun-tang-spicy-fish-stew&quot;&gt;Maeun-tang (spicy fish stew)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/stew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fish stew&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing sashimi at a restaurant, you can order Maeun-tang (spicy fish stew) made with the bones, head, and the remaining meat of the fish, and you need to pay extra charge like 5000won or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This food really goes very well with soju so if you love Soju and some spicy Soups in Korea like various Jjigae or Ramyeon, you don’t want to miss it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/03/somaek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;drinks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a hevy drinker or if you just like drinking, never forget to order soem drinks with Sashimi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.SI’ll post how to make best Somaek later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a common list of ‘things to do in Seoul’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;1explore-palaces--visit-cultural-villages&quot;&gt;1.Explore palaces &amp;amp; Visit cultural villages&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;2shop-at-myeongdong-and-dongdaemun&quot;&gt;2.Shop at Myeongdong and Dongdaemun&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;3try-street-foods&quot;&gt;3.Try street foods&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;4enjoy-parks&quot;&gt;4.Enjoy parks&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;5nightlife-at-hongdae-gangnam-itaewon&quot;&gt;5.Nightlife at Hongdae, Gangnam. Itaewon…&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve searched about ‘Things to do Seoul’, you’ve probably seen this kind of list a lot.
Of course that list is also good, but you should know that because some of the lists are for foreign tourists only, most locals don’t actually visit those places and don’t do that kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then let’s check the list one by one from the local point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;1explore-palaces--visit-cultural-villages-1&quot;&gt;1.Explore palaces &amp;amp; Visit cultural villages&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/02/palace.png&quot; alt=&quot;palace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For no.1, every places are breathtaking so you don’t want to miss it. The Five Grand Palaces in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeonghuigung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, but you can just try some places that you want to go.
Most palaces have free guides tour so you can check that out and join without reservation (Individuals less than 10 people, but for groups with 10 or more people must make a reservation in advance).
 Also there are some ceremonies called ‘The changing ceremony of the royal guard’, and these are really cool so if you are planning to visit palace, make sure to check the time table of these ceremonies in advance. Plus, If you want something more special memory, you can also join the ceremonies so please check this out (http://www.royalguard.kr/0106.php)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a lot of cultural villages such as Insadong, Ikseondong, Bukchon Hanok village, Samcheongdong, Seochon Hanok village,… Those places are usually not that big and all are located near Gyeongbok Palace, so you can look around at once and sightseeing doesn’t take that long. Every streets have different vibes and also there are so many various street vendors and buskers, so it is really fun to take a walk looking around.
(Insadong is known for shopping especially for foreigners, but I don’t want to recommend you because I find their products are little boring and way too pricy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;2shop-at-myeongdong-and-dongdaemun-1&quot;&gt;2.Shop at Myeongdong and Dongdaemun&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/02/myeongdong.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;myeongdong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For no.2, this list is really one of the lists that the locals don’t understand. Myeongdong and Dongdaemun, of course, are one of the best places to shop, but locals rarely prefer this places because these places are way too commercial and crowded. Also things are really expensive since most customers are foreigners, so if you want to go there, I recommend you to consider a lot before buying something. (I don’t recommend you to try some street foods in there as well, because even though it’s not that nice it’s way pricy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to go to Dongdaemun, You need to be careful not to get ripped off! Some vendors in there could force you to try some clothes and buy and they tend to rip you off (They even do that to the locals) so you should be extra careful in there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;3try-street-foods-1&quot;&gt;3.Try street foods&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/02/streetfood.png&quot; alt=&quot;streetfoods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In local’s opinion, street foods in Korea are definitely one of the things that you should try! There are so many places for street foods, but I recommend you the markets such as Gwangjang, Tongin, and some college towns, and you also can try some unique street foods in Common ground, Seoul bamdokkaebi night market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional markets which are Gwangjang, Tongin are more reasonable than Common ground, Seoul bamdokkaebi night markey because for the latter, that places are sort of modern places run by young people therefor their foods are kind of fancy fusion foods.
I recommend you to visit both options because the vibe of the two options is totally different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;4enjoy-parks-1&quot;&gt;4.Enjoy parks&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/02/park.png&quot; alt=&quot;parks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many awesome parks in Seoul so you can just search the list of parks in Seoul and try! Parks near by Han river are really cool so just give it a shot and never forget to try ramen there. Gyeongui Line Forest Park which is called Yeontral park is also one of the best parks in Seoul. It’s located near by Hongdae, Yeonnamdong. You should go to Yeontral park and grab some beer in the park while enjoying People’s busking there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;5nightlife-at-hongdae-gangnam-itaewon-1&quot;&gt;5.Nightlife at Hongdae, Gangnam. Itaewon…&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/02/hongdae.png&quot; alt=&quot;hongdae&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hongdae, Gangnam. Itaewon are well known for nightlife, so there are so many stunning bars, but if you really want to enjoy local’s places you need to find another places as well. Therefor I will post lots of local bars which is located in another district all over Seoul, so please stay tuned Geeks’ things Korea!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Habni</name></author><category term="KOREA" /><category term="Thingstodoinkorea" /><category term="Koreatravel" /><category term="Koreatravelblog" /><category term="한국여행" /><summary type="html">Since Seoul is the biggest city which is capital city in South Korea, so Seoul is always one of ‘must go places’ for foreigner tourists. so that’s why there are so many tourists in Seoul.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22secondthumb.png%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22secondthumb.png%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to GEEKS’ THINGS KOREA</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/description-of-geeks-things-korea-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to GEEKS' THINGS KOREA" /><published>2019-12-11T16:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-12-11T16:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/post01</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/description-of-geeks-things-korea-1/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;kcicking-it-like-a-geek-in-korea&quot;&gt;Kcicking it like a geek in Korea!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post/01/firstpost.png&quot; alt=&quot;mainpic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more tourists are coming to Korea nowadays. South Korea is small but there are so many various things to do. But most of tourists are just going and hanging out in some particular places like Gangnam, Hongdae and Itaewon something like that. However there’s more and more things that you can enjoy here, but the point is it’s not that easy to find some informations about it for foreigners. Of course you can google it, but it feels like our professor “Google” always gives you the same and boring informations, recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why I opened this website. I would like to show the real local things and something special than the other pages that you’ve searched so far. It could be something minor nothing  like major things which travelers normally do in Korea.
 I’d like recommend you the things that I love to do, like shopping vintage stuffs, visiting old local bars, finding out some cool exhibitions, reviewing various stationaries and school things, taking pictures with film cameras and visiting photo studios to print that photos, trying to go on a bus trip, and so on. So you can find something interesting through my posts and figure out “How Korean geeks enjoy their Korean lives”.
I guarantee you that you can get more more ideas like ‘things to do in Korea’ from my page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-contents-in-geeks-things-korea&quot;&gt;About contents in Geeks’ things Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 categories in ‘Geek’s things Korea’ website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.The things
 This category is about all ‘things’ in Korea. so It could be some reviews, recommendations about the foods, products on Korean market, DIY kits, vintage antique stuffs that I bought and want to share with you… whatever.
 You will be able to read some reviews or recommendations and get informations from those so that you can also try for real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.The things to do
 This category is about ‘the things to do in Korea’ but it will be totally different from another trip advise and recommendations because I will post somethings that even some local don’t know about. (maybe geek’s way to enjoy)&lt;/p&gt;
