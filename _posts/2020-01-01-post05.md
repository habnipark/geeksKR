#### Cool Fashion street Garosu-gil

 Have you ever heard of Garosu-gil? Garosu-gil is located in Sinsa-dong Gangnam Seoul.

For some reasons,  Garosu-gil(street) district is definitely one of My foreign friends’ favorite places and according to them, they just really like looking around there like literally exploring there and doing some shoppings as well.

 Garosu street has a lot of stylish and unique shops, international brands, nice restaurants, cafes and numerous cool bars so there’s no wonder many people just fall in love with this place. Besides because of those reasons Garosu-gil is always crowded with cool people so it’s not that surprising to see some fashion models or some celebs walking down the streets in Garosu-gil.

 Anyway since there are lots of stunning places to visit in Garosu-gil, In my opinion you don’t even need to google where to go. You can just go there and try to visit every places that you want to visit.

#### Mikkeller

 But there’s some places that my foreign friends and I love so bad, so I’d like to recommend you one of those place "Mikkeller" today.

 Actually Mikkeller is an international breweriy started in Copenhagen Denmark, and they export their own brewed beers to almost 40 different countries and almost 50 shops are also around the world.

 Mikkeller Seoul is located in back alley in Garosu-gil so that there is not that crowded usually quiet.

#### Unique building facade

When you arrived at Mikkeller Seoul, you can see Sally and Henry welcoming people politely in front of the bar.

You can easily find unique facade of the building cause the owner of Mikkller Seoul has worked with  Mikkeller’s Art director Keith Shore together to try to add some Korean elements to Mikkeller’s own Danish style. so that’s why I found their building facade is so cool and special out of this world.

#### Cute paintings

#### About their beer

They offer 30 different beers on tap from Mikkeller which are from Mikkeller, their own special brewed beer, and other selected  breweries around the world.

 They always take good care of beer quality strictly so you can always have freshest beer even from another countries.

They have various types of beers APA, IPA, Fruit Lambic, Stout, Porter and even some bottle beers as well. They also have nice food and snack menu!

![glass](/img/post/05/5_07.jpg)

If you are a person who drink beers like water, this place could be little bit pricy because their glass is kind of small for its price in my opinion.

<br>

But as long as I can enjoy awesome beers and their chill mood, I'll always love to go there!

I guarantee you’ll love this place too!
