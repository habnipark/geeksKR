 Back in the days, I just found some post and that post was about ‘Kimchi fried rice recipe’.
 When I first read that post, I wasn’t interested at all because Kimchi fried rice is one of the easiest foods to cook and very familiar foods for Korean.
 However, when I read the comments on that post, I was shocked and changed my mind to try to follow that recipe because every Korean was crazy about that recipe saying

**"There's no other Kimchi fried rice except for this for the rest of my life! "**

 After that day, You know what? I can’t remember exactly but I think I had Kimchi fried rices for almost more than 7 days in a row!!! And I still cook this often following that legendary recipe  because whenever It comes to my mind I have a craving for this food.

##### Tips!

1. Tuna is optional so you can use another ingredients like ham, bacon, meat, mushroom and so on but the original recipe is ‘using canned tuna’

2. Red pepper powder is important ingredient! we use this ingredient instead of Gochujang for this original legendary Kimchi fried rice recipe.

3. Oligosaccharide, corn syrup is also important you can use honey also but the former is batter. and we also use this this ingredient instead of sugar.

4. Dasida(Korean beef stock) is most important ingredient! You can buy this easily at Kmart or you can also use beef stock

5. Don’t forget the sunny-side-up!
